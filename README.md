# Telecome-Churn-Case-Study
### Business Problem: In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, due to this the telecom industry experiences an average of 15-25% of annual churn rate. And it cost 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one. And for the incumbent operator, reatining the high profitable customers is the number one business goal.

### Requirement: To identify the high risk churning customer and identify the main indicator of those churn customers among the high profitable customers.

### Solution: Build the logistic regression model with 100% recall which is able to identify those important indicator that is helpful for predicting the high risk churning customers.
